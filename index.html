                    Challa pare kalilo mayama
                    <br /> <br />
                    Nidharko tyo rato tika<br />
                    Chhap bani basyo yo dilaima<br />
                    Jhalkeko tyo nakko phuli<br />
                    Jyoti banyo kalilo mayama<br />

                    Patli tyo madhur onth swaad<br />
                    Bani pasyo yo dilaima<br />
