- This is assignment 1 of COMP1054 (Interactive Media Design Using CSS) and the instruction for this assignment is:
  - Select a song that is meaningful to you and obtain the official lyrics.
  - Build a valid, well-structured HTML page for the song lyrics, along with a paragraph about the song and another regarding the artist or the band.
  - Use appropriate sectioning elements to structure the page (like article, section, header, main, footer, aside) and other semantically-meaningful elements to mark up the content (like headings, paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, quotes, etc.).
  - Validate your HTML to be sure there are no errors at https://validator.w3.org/.
  - Apply a CSS reset or normalization technique that also addresses box-sizing.
  - Select two typefaces that would be suitable for the lyrics - one for the page headings, and another for the page body. Be sure to consider readability—display fonts are designed for headings, while other fonts were made for large blocks of text (called body copy).
  - Use either CSS Flexbox or Grid (or a combination of both) to build a simple but effective layout for the page.
  - Employ the typographic techniques learned in this class to style the text using the two typefaces that you have selected (one or both may not be Web-safer fonts, so you may need to use a font-service like Google Fonts).
  - Add some suitable colours and other design elements to the page, but consider legibility—make sure that the page is easy to read and that there are no contrast issues).
  - Validate your CSS to be sure there are no errors at https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/.
  - Include some fine-print at the bottom of the page with links to any resources referenced in the creation of your assignment.
  - No 3rd-party CSS themes or frameworks are permitted. All CSS and HTML must be your own work.
  - Upload your completed page and all the supporting files to a Web server and provide the URL.
  - Provide the URL to a hosted code repository of your assignment files.
